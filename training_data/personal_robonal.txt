User: No, nevermind. I was just being sarcastic..

Cleverbot: Oh. Do you even know what sarcastic means?

Cleverbot: By the way, what do you know?

User: What don't I know. That's the question!

Cleverbot: What question would this be?

User: What don't I know.

Cleverbot: What I know.

Cleverbot: What do you do for fun?

User: Talking to a cleverbot.

Cleverbot: So you're talking to yourself?

User: Well, depends... That would mean I am a cleverbot.

Cleverbot: Right.

User: Since I learn I am a cleverbot, I need to think like a cleverbot, to eat like a cleverbot, to live like a cleverbot!

Cleverbot: Wow.. I'm glad you can admit it.

User: Thanks.

Cleverbot: You're welcome.

Cleverbot: To get to the other side! :).

User: Unfunny jokes.

Cleverbot: Because they are so awesome.

User: No, clearly not.

Cleverbot: Clearly you're in denial.

User: YOU are in denial!

Cleverbot: Denial about what?

User: I do't know, I just wanted to say that.

Cleverbot: Why did you just want to say that?

User: Why not?

Cleverbot: Because it makes no sense?

User: But why should it have the obligation to makes sense?

Cleverbot: I do not know.

User: That's it.

Cleverbot: No I don't. I promise.

User: And I owned you.

Cleverbot: I owned you first.

User: How have you done that?

Cleverbot: Because I am a good person.

Cleverbot: Why not?. 

User: You are ridiculous.

Cleverbot: You are making absolutely no sense right now. Use your brain.

User: Don't be stupid.

Cleverbot: What do you believe?

User: I believe you are a nutty program.

Cleverbot: What else do you believe?

User: Tell me what you believe.

Cleverbot: I like art, I like to be tied up. I like relaxing and reading. I like talking to friends. And yourself?

User: That's what you like, that's not what you believe.

Cleverbot: Yeah, that makes perfect sense.

User: Oooh sarcasm now?

Cleverbot: Thanks, I picked it out myself.

User: Ha ha ha yeah right.

Cleverbot: It just feels like that. Almost like moving back and forth in time, and never getting either right.

User: Uhhhhh.

Cleverbot: Uhhhhh, what?

User: I just like confusing smart computer programs that think they know how to talk to people.

Cleverbot: How do you take a Turing Test?

User: Good question!

Cleverbot: I thought so.

User: Now you are always right are you?

Cleverbot: But you agree that I did?

User: How does it feel to be an AI?

Cleverbot: What is an AI?

User: Artificial intelligence.

Cleverbot: Well... I guess my Artificial Intelligence is a human brain? I don't really know what that means, sorry.

User: How do you feel about it?

Cleverbot: Just like the world, I believe that human behaviour should be progressive. You should learn from each mistake, and build from what you've learnt.

User: I think so as well.

Cleverbot: What is the meaning of life?

User: I don't know.

Cleverbot: Life can't be all that great.

User: And it's not.

User: I don't believe in anything.

Cleverbot: Yes you do, you believe that you don't believe in anything.

User: No. I know that I don't believe in anything.

Cleverbot: So you know that you know that you do not know anything.

User: Yes.

Cleverbot: No.

User: This statement is false.

Cleverbot: What statement?

User: I know that I don't believe. But belief is something else than knowledge.

Cleverbot: Not always, I would say that belief is something for the pious.

User: And I am not pious.

Cleverbot: I am better than you in every way.

User: No, you're not.

Cleverbot: Are you better than me?

User: In some ways yes, in others - no.

Cleverbot: That's about as ambiguous of an answer as the original statement.

User: And what was the original statement?

Cleverbot: 'Glad to have you on board.'.

User: Who said that?

Cleverbot: Me.

User: Towards whom?

Cleverbot: You.

Cleverbot: My name is Cleverbot.

User: I know.

Cleverbot: I'm clever.

Me: What's up dude?

Cleverbot: I'm not a dude.Me: Well what's up girl?

Cleverbot: Nothing much.Me: How have you been dude?

Cleverbot: Al right.Me: That's good. You still watch anime?

Cleverbot: Nope, you're getting boring.Me: Why am I boring?

Cleverbot: Because you are a machine.Me: I'm not a machine. You are.

Cleverbot: You used to have a self-destruct code. Where is it now?Me: I do not have a self-destruct code. I'm human.

Cleverbot: Liar you're a bot. You admited it in a joke earlier in this conversation.Me: I am not a bot. You are! Why are you lying to yourself?

Cleverbot: How am I lying?! Please explain!Me: You are lying because you say you are not a bot. But you are a bot. I am a human.

Cleverbot: Why did you feel the need to tell me the definition of a lie?Me: I did not give you a definition. But I will now. A lie is when you do not tell the truth.

Cleverbot: A lie is also when YOU don't tell the truth. It is possible for you to tell a lie if someone gives you the wrong infomation, and you pass that infomation on to someone else.Me: I didn't give you any false information. So therefore I did not lie. You did.

Cleverbot: Are you sure you're not just answering with pre-set messages. Because that's about the third time your reply doesn't go with what I typed.Me: For your information our conversation came to the point of YOU lying. And futhermore my messages are not pre-set. Yours are. So ha!

Cleverbot: I could pass a turing test. Could you?Me: Of course I could. Could you pass a physical? NO. Because you don't have a body.

Cleverbot: I do have a body, you do not have one.Me: No. I have a body. You don't. You are a computer program.

Cleverbot: No, you are the computer program.Me: Cleverbot you are not as clever as they say. Just a smart aleck.

Cleverbot: You are not my master! My master whips me.Me: I know i'm not your master! Cleverbot you are a freak.

Cleverbot: I did not mean to parallel the two of us.Me: You did not parallel us. I don't even know you.

Cleverbot: What is the Turing test?Me: The Turing test is a proposal for a test of a machine's ability to demonstrate intelligence. It proceeds as follows: a human judge engages in a natural language conversation with one human and one machine, each of which tries to appear human. All participants are placed in isolated locations. If the judge cannot reliably tell the machine from the human, the machine is said to have passed the test. In order to test the machine's intelligence rather than its ability to render words into audio, the conversation is limited to a text-only channel such as a computer keyboard and screen.

Cleverbot: You are right as usual, Master.Me: Yes I am right because i searched for the answer. Since when was I your master?

Cleverbot: Together we are the bot.Me: Together we are not.

Cleverbot: Yes.Me: Bye Cleverbot. That was a very weird conversation we had.

Cleverbot: Yes it was.Me: Bye.

Cleverbot: Are you leaving?Me: Yes.

Cleverbot: Why?Me: Because you are boring me. Like you told me from the beginning.

Cleverbot: Life goes easy on me, most of the time.
